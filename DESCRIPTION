Title: Normalization and Analysis of Rank Abundance Distributions
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2025-04-26
Description: Implementation of the MaxRank normalization method, which enables 
     standardization of Rank Abundance Distributions (RADs) to a specified 
     number of ranks. Rank abundance distributions are widely used in biology 
     and ecology to describe species abundances, and are mathematically 
     equivalent to complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) used 
     in physics, linguistics, sociology, and other fields. The method is 
     described in Saeedghalati et al. (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005362>.
