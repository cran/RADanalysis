Title: Normalization and Study of Rank Abundance Distributions
Version: 0.5.5
Date: 2016-03-14
Description: It has tools for normalization of rank abundance
     distributions (RAD) to a desired number of ranks using MaxRank
     Normalization method.
     RADs are commonly used in biology/ecology and mathematically equivalent
     to complementary cumulative distributions (CCDFs) which are used in
     physics, linguistics and sociology and more generally in data science.
